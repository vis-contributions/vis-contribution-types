### Algorithmic simplification	
simplification or explanation of techniques and algorithms to make them easier to understand and reproduce

### Artistic Design	
practices and evaluative reflection on expressiveness and utility of visualization

### Data abstraction	
mapping of data from a domain/problem to abstract data and dataset types

### Data structures	
improvements or new uses of existing ones to support visualization

### Dataset	
publicly available dataset for use in understanding visualizations, e.g., their construction, consumption, design, or interpretation

### Deployment	
discussion of insights gained from real world deployment of a visualization 

### Discourse	
theoretical and practical evidence to challenge an existing (design) guideline

### Design methodology	
methodologies that helps people take a structured and formalised approach to visualisation design

### Evaluation methodology	
methodologies that enable new ways in evaluating visualisation solutions

### Formalism	
generalized theoretical, algorithmic, or mathematical formalisms of visualization concepts

### Guidelines	
generalized advice for the design and use of visualizations and visualization techniques

### Lessons from failure	
discussion of negative results including identification of pitfalls to be avoided

### Mechanism	
foundational understanding of perception and cognition to explain how visualization works

### New data or dataset type	
dataset type, data type, or facet of data previously unseen and unhandled in visualization

### New domains	
thorough discussion of domain not previously seen in visualization, its description and research challenges

### New problem	
previously unaddressed or undiscussed visualization problems

### Performance analysis	
analysis of running visualizations and visualization algorithms efficiently on real devices

### Presentation	
methodology or discussion of insights for storytelling and expository applications such as data journalism and education

### Qualitative empirical findings	
findings from ethnographic and other deeply qualitative methods; understanding of how people approach or use tools in situ

### Replication	
reproduction of previously-published research and comparison of results

### Survey	
summary and enumeration of the state of the art 

### Systematic reviews	
structured review and synthesis of the available literature grounded in a well-defined methodology

### Task abstraction	
mapping of tasks performed by domain users to abstract tasks from a task taxonomy

### Taxonomies and conceptual models	
systematic characterizations of a particular space that scaffolds thinking within that topic

### Technique	
novel components or methodologies of a visualization including visual representations, interaction techniques or modalities, methods used for evaluation, and others

### Toolkits / Languages / Architectures	
design and implementation of a novel platform for developing visualizations

### Vision	
well-argued and well-supported visions of the future of visualization
### Visual data analysis methodology	
novel combination of established visualization and interaction techniques to perform data analysis

###Yet Unlisted Contributions	
ideas, results, discussions, and/or yet undiscovered units of effort that help the community solve visualization problems but have not been listed here
